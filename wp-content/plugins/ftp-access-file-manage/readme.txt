Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WitFTP" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking "Install Now".

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your site. To do a manual install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu, click Add New, click Upload (top links) and finally select the downloaded file.
