= Don't Risk Losing Your Website =
Does the thought of losing your website keep you up at night? All that time, effort and money you've invested could be gone in an instant.

WordPress is an incredible product but there are many things that can go wrong.  You could get hacked, your hosting company could go out of business, you could install a bad plugin or theme, the list is endless, and without a good backup, you could lose everything.

If this isn't something that keeps you up at night, then it really should be. It was keeping us up at night so we decided to do something about it.  In 2012 we created the WPBackItUp backup plugin and made it freely available to the WordPress community.

Since 2012 we have added many incredible features and have even created a premium version of our backup plugin, but our fundamental goal has remained the same.   We want to make creating a WordPress backup as **simple**, **effective** and **complete** as possible.  We don’t want anything to prevent you from regularly creating a backup of your WordPress site.

We offer the Community Edition of our backup plugin for free so that you will **BackItUp** and sleep better at night.
