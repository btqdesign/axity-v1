Lets you create a document template, add fields and questions and send it out to people to fill in.

== Description ==

The GroupDocs Assembly WordPress plugin lets you collect data to automatically create new documents online by embedding GroupDocs Assembly questionnaires. 

GroupDocs Assembly is an online document automation and document assembly app. [Document assembly](http://groupdocs.com/apps/Assembly) is the process of collecting information and creating new documents. It is often used for letters, contracts and quotes: document where most of the information remains the same, but some details - name, address, date, start date or income, for example - varies from person to person. The process is simple:

  1. First, prepare a template by adding fields to a document.
  2. Then create a questionnaire that helps recipients enter data.
  3. Finally, share the questionnaire.

Please note:
To use the document assembly module, you need to [sign up with us](https://apps.groupdocs.com/sign-up
) first. But don't worry, we provide a free 14-day trial, so that you can test the viewer first.

Document assembly takes care of itself and for each person who completes the questionnaire; a new, unique document is created.
